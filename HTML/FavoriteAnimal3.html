     The fennec fox weighs about 1.5–3.5 lb (0.68–1.59 kg), with a body length of between 24–41 cm (9–16 in); it is around 20.3 cm (8 in) tall.
     <br>
     It is the smallest species of canid in the world.
     The tail has a black tip and is 18–31 cm (7–12 in) long, while the ears can be between 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in) long.
     <br>
     The coat is often a cream color and fluffy, which deflects heat during the day and keeps the fox warm at night.
     <br>
     The fennec's characteristic ears are the largest among all foxes relative to body size,and serve to dissipate heat, as they have many blood vessels close to the skin. 
    <br>
The ears of a fennec are sensitive enough to hear prey that may be underground; the soles of its feet are protected from the hot desert sand by thick fur.</div>

  <p>The fennec fox is an omnivore. Food sources include plants, rodents, insects, birds, eggs, and rabbits. An individual can jump up to 2 ft (61 cm) high and 4 ft (120 cm) forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators. When hunting, large-eared foxes such as the fennec, or the bat-eared fox, can seem to stare at the ground while they rotate their heads from side to side to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground.</p>

  <p>Fennec foxes are social animals that mate for life, with each pair or family controlling their own territory. Sexual maturity is reached at around nine months old. In the wild, mating usually occurs between January and February for litters to be born between March and April. However, in captivity most litters are born later, between March and July, although births can occur year-round. The species usually breeds only once each year. The copulation tie has been recorded as lasting up to two hours and 45 minutes. Following mating, the male becomes very aggressive and protective of the female, providing her with food during her pregnancy and lactation periods.</p>

  <p>The fennec fox is the national animal of Algeria. It also serves as the nickname for the Algeria national football team: "Les Fennecs". Fennec is the code name for Mozilla's Firefox for mobile project. A fennec fox named Finnick was depicted in Disney's Zootopia. As a result of the popularity of the movie, the Los Angeles Times reported that Chinese children are begging their parents to procure the animals as pets. Fennekin, the Fire-type starter Pokémon from Pokémon X and Y, is based off the fennec fox.</p>
