    <ol> 
    <li> On January 31, 1919, Jack Roosevelt 
    "Jackie" Robinson was born into a family of sharecroppers on a plantation in Cairo, Georgia
    .</li>
    <li> Robinson faced near-constant racial abuse after entering the minors as baseball's first black player.
    Many teams cancelled exhibition games to prevent him from playing, 
    and he was regularly subjected to jeers from fans and fellow players alike. </li>
    <li> His first-ever hit in the Major Leagues was a bunt, and he went on to lead the league with 28 sacrifice hits during his debut season. 
    Of the 46 bunts Robinson laid down in 1947, all except four resulted in either a base hit or a sacrifice.</li>
    <li> Robinson often received death threats against himself and his family, 
    but in 1951 the danger seemed so imminent that the Feds were called in to investigate.</li>
    <li> After retiring from baseball in 1957, Robinson devoted himself to the civil rights movement and became an active voice in politics. </li></ol>
